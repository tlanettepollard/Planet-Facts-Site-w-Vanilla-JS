Today I learned how to set up a package.json file using npm in the terminal. I then added sass and bootstrap and an autoprefixer. Learning how to override Bootstrap styles using a custom.scss. You go into the variables file and copy the variables you will need to override. Still learning that the order of how you import your files into the main scss file matters on how variables are defined.

I may switch to HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS. I having a hard time with Flexbox and CSS Grid conflicts with Bootstrap.

A fellow coder suggested that I just code with regular HTML for that section if there is a conflict. I decided to start again without Bootstrap.

I searched to find an alternative to using `onClick` in my HTML. I was having a hard time finding a way to set up the addEventListener. I will keep searching.
