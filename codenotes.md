Today I learned how to set up a package.json file using npm in the terminal. I then added sass and bootstrap and an autoprefixer. Learning how to override Bootstrap styles using a custom.scss. You go into the variables file and copy the variables you will need to override. Still learning that the order of how you import your files into the main scss file matters on how variables are defined.

### 08/26/2021

Today I am still learning/working about overriding Bootstrap5 variables.

### 08/27/2021

I may switch to HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS. I having a hard time with Flexbox and CSS Grid conflicts with Bootstrap.

### 08/28/2021

A fellow coder suggested that I just code with regular HTML for that section if there is a conflict. I decided to start again without Bootstrap.

### 08/31/2021

I've decided to use all of the planet index pages instead of importing the json file. I'm keeping the other files just in case.

### 09/03/2021

I'm going to try to add the information using the data.json file. Wish me luck. I made the planet icons for the mobile menu using Sketch. I am so proud of myself. My planet icons look awesome! For my responsive navigation, I am referring to:

### 09/04/2021

Today I am working on the responsive navbar. I used a tutorial on dev.to. Posted link yesterday. I was able to add transition and have the mobileNav as an offcanvas menu. I am referring to a fellow coder for importing data into the website. I also researched DOM style using JS.

### 09/05/2021

I searched to find an alternative to using `onClick` in my HTML. I was having a hard time finding a way to set up the addEventListener. I will keep searching.

### 09/12/2021

Working on my JS and using the data.json to load information into the webpage.

### 09/16/2021

Still having issues about how to organize my code. I get so caught up in how I should do it that I get stuck in my head.

### 09/18/2021

Still working on my JS. I got the data to appear in my HTML. Now I need to work on my links. Trying to figure out the correct logic.

### 09/19/2021

I'm starting again. I've made this too difficult and I'm becoming frustrated. I added the page links to my index.html. Now I will just use JS to add the information.

### 09/21/2021

Working on adding the data to the html. I'm still following KevinGBojan. I added data to the json file so there were less objects as const. Still having problems updating the information when each page is changed.

### 09/26/2021

Back again. Did some more research on using onclick vs addEventListener. The clicking and changing the pages content has held me up.

### 09/30/2021

Did some research on using addEventListeners vs using onClick/onclick. I've seen other coders use onclick & onClick in their HTML for the links that change the planet pages. I've read that using onclick isn't best practice. I had to do more research.

### 10/02/2021

Trying to do the JS on my own. Starting again for the fifth time. I finally figured out how to use addEventListener instead of onclick. I was able to put the events for the description buttons in the displayPlanetInfo function.

### 10092021

I started this project two months ago. it shouldn't have taken me this long to complete this website. My indecision has gotten in the way. I've tried to be efficient. I've researched ways to set up the project. I really wanted to use HTML/CSS/JS. I wanted to import the data into each the page. I've managed to do that. However, I opted to handle the sizing of the images in JS as well. Not sure that was the best thing to do. So, I've decided to go back to the basic information in the JSON file and adjust the image sizes and colors in CSS.

I've also had a battle with onclick, onClick, and addEventListener. I keep reading it's not best practice to use onclick in HTML. Yet, I keep seeing people use this practice. (See 09/30/2021 Notes)

### 10/10/2021

I just saw a Medium article today that I wished I saw when I began this project. It gave 10 signs that you can use to determine if your website needs JavaScript. It was eye-opening and mindblowing! (Well for me it was.) That article points out that many websites are just fine with just CSS and HTML. It doesn't say don't use JS, just use it wisely and sparingly for certain projects. It's also talking about the client-side experience not the server side. It made me realize that I need to determine the amount of JS I use depending on the goal of the site. In this case, since I'm only serving static content and there will be a simple toggle to show information, I don't need to use as much JS to accomplish that task.

I followed aborron as a guide. I added the fetch script to each HTML page. Now I have all of my pages populated with the planet's information.

### 10/17/2021

I'm back. I did some research to figure out how to overlap the planet image and the geology surface image. One coder placed the images as a background image. I tried to see how it could be done with CSS Grid. I didn't have much luck. So, back to positioning I go.

### 10/23/2021

Finally back to working on my project. Now I'm trying to style my pages. I'm using a mix of flex and grid on some of my page sections.

### 10/24/2021

I made some progress today. I used CSS to set the buttons to the planet color on page load. So far it's worked out well.

### 02/05/2022

It's been a while but I am back.
