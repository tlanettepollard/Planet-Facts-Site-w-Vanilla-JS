# Frontend Mentor - Planets fact site

![Design preview for the Planets fact site coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for purchasing this premium Frontend Mentor coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. These premium challenges are perfect portfolio pieces, so please feel free to use what you create in your portfolio to show others.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this 8-page planets fact site and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you choose to use a JS-heavy approach, we provide a local `data.json` file for the planets. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the separate `.html` files.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

Want some support on the challenge? [Join our Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) and ask questions in the **#help** channel.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the design file provided. We provide both Sketch and Figma versions of the design, so you can choose which tool you prefer to use. You can download the design file on the platform. **Please be sure not to share them with anyone else.** The design download comes with a `README.md` file as well to help you get set up.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The assets are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some images are reusable at multiple screen sizes. So if you don't see an image in a specific folder, it will typically be in another folder for that page.

The design system in the design file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Separate the `starter-code` from the rest of this project and rename it to something meaningful for you. Initialize the codebase as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/). **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è: There are already a couple of `.gitignore` files in this project. Please do not remove them or change the content of the files. If you create a brand new project, please use the `.gitignore` files provided in your new codebase. This is to avoid the accidental upload of the design files to GitHub. With these premium challenges, please be sure not to share the design files in your GitHub repo. Thanks!**
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a web address. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, and we provide some recommendations below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers. [Read more about our recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).

## Create a custom `README.md`

We strongly recommend overwriting this `README.md` with a custom one. We've provided a template inside the [`README-template.md`](./README-template.md) file in this starter code.

The template provides a guide for what to add. A custom `README` will help you explain your project and reflect on your learnings. Please feel free to edit our template as much as you like.

Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.

## Submitting your solution

Submit your solution on the platform for the rest of the community to see. Follow our ["Complete guide to submitting solutions"](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248) for tips on how to do this.

Remember, if you're looking for feedback on your solution, be sure to ask questions when submitting it. The more specific and detailed you are with your questions, the higher the chance you'll get valuable feedback from the community.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è: With these premium challenges, please be sure not to upload the design files to GitHub when you're submitting to the platform and sharing it around. If you've created a brand new project, the easiest way to do that is to copy across the `.gitignore` provided in this starter project.**

## Sharing your solution

There are multiple places you can share your solution:

1. Share your solution page in the **#finished-projects** channel of the [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack).
2. Tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor**, including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.
3. Share your solution on other social channels like LinkedIn.
4. Blog about your experience building your project. Writing about your workflow, technical choices, and talking through your code is a brilliant way to reinforce what you've learned. Great platforms to write on are [dev.to](https://dev.to/), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), and [CodeNewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/).

We provide templates to help you share your solution once you've submitted it on the platform. Please do edit them and include specific questions when you're looking for feedback.

The more specific you are with your questions the more likely it is that another member of the community will give you feedback.

## Got feedback for us?

We love receiving feedback! We're always looking to improve our challenges and our platform. So if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email hi[at]frontendmentor[dot]io.

**Have fun building!** üöÄ

<!-- Internal Structure Content Start

  Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a
  solid, iron sulfide outer core layer, a deeper liquid core layer, and
  a solid inner core. The planet's density is the second highest in the
  Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3 , only slightly less than Earth's density.-->

 <!--Source : Wikipedia  URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)#Internal_structure -->

  <!-- Internal Structure Content End -->

  <!-- Surface Geology Content Start 

  Mercury's surface is similar in appearance to that of the Moon, showing 
  extensive mare-like plains and heavy cratering, indicating that it has 
  been geologically inactive for billions of years. It is more heterogeneous 
  than either Mars's or the Moon‚Äôs.-->

Venus

  <!-- Overview Content Start -->

Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the
Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest natural object
in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and
can be, on rare occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.

Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus -->

  <!-- Overview Content End -->

  <!-- Internal Structure Content Start -->

The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests
they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust.
Like that of Earth, Venusian core is most likely at least partially
liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate.

  <!-- Internal Structure Content End -->

  <!-- Surface Geology Content Start -->

Much of the Venusian surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity.
Venus has several times as many volcanoes as Earth, and it has 167 large
volcanoes that are over 100 km (60 mi) across. The only volcanic complex
of this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii.

Uranus

  <!-- Overview Content Start -->

Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its name is a reference to the
Greek god of the sky, Uranus according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather
of Ares. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary
mass in the Solar System.

Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus -->

  <!-- Overview Content End -->

  <!-- Internal Structure Content Start -->

The standard model of Uranus's structure is that it consists of three layers: a
rocky (silicate/iron‚Äìnickel) core in the centre, an icy mantle in the middle and
an outer gaseous hydrogen/helium envelope. The core is relatively small, with a
mass of only 0.55 Earth masses.

Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus#Internal_structure -->

  <!-- Internal Structure Content End -->

  <!-- Surface Geology Content Start -->

The composition of Uranus's atmosphere is different from its bulk, consisting mainly
of molecular hydrogen and helium. The helium molar fraction, i.e. the number of
helium atoms per molecule of gas, is 0.15¬±0.03 in the upper troposphere.

Earth

  <!-- Overview Content Start -->

Third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to harbor life.
About 29.2% of Earth's surface is land with remaining 70.8% is
covered with water. Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties
and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive.

Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth -->

  <!-- Overview Content End -->

  <!-- Internal Structure Content Start -->

Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided
into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The
outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is
underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle.

Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#Internal_structure -->

  <!-- Internal Structure Content End -->

  <!-- Surface Geology Content Start -->

The total surface area of Earth is about 510 million km2. The continental
crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks granite
and andesite. Less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the
primary constituent of the ocean floors.

Jupiter

  <!-- Overview Content Start -->

Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.
It is a gas giant with a mass two and a half times that of all the other
planets in the Solar System combined, but less than one-thousandth the mass
of the Sun.

Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter -->

  <!-- Overview Content End -->

  <!-- Internal Structure Content Start -->

When the Juno arrived in 2016, it found that Jupiter has a very diffuse core
that mixes into its mantle. A possible cause is an impact from a planet of
about ten Earth masses a few million years after Jupiter's formation, which
would have disrupted an originally solid Jovian core.

Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter#Internal_structure -->

  <!-- Internal Structure Content End -->

  <!-- Surface Geology Content Start -->

The best known feature of Jupiter is the Great Red Spot, a persistent
anticyclonic storm located 22¬∞ south of the equator. It is known to have
existed since at least 1831, and possibly since 1665.

Mars

  <!-- Overview Content Start -->

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet
in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars
carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as
the "Red Planet".

Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars -->

  <!-- Overview Content End -->

  <!-- Internal Structure Content Start -->

Like Earth, Mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid
by less dense materials. Scientists initially determined that the core
is at least partially liquid. Current models of its interior imply a
core consisting primarily of iron and nickel with about 16‚Äì17% sulfur.

Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars#Internal_structure -->

  <!-- Internal Structure Content End -->

  <!-- Surface Geology Content Start -->

Mars is a terrestrial planet whose surface consists of minerals containing
silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock.
The surface is primarily composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are
more silica-rich than typical basalt.

Neptune

  <!-- Overview Content Start -->

Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar
System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet,
and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, more massive than
its near-twin Uranus.

Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune -->

  <!-- Overview Content End -->

  <!-- Internal Structure Content Start -->

Neptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5%
to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10% to 20% of the way towards the core.
Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in the lower regions.

Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune#Internal_structure -->

  <!-- Internal Structure Content End -->

  <!-- Surface Geology Content Start -->

Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium. A trace amount of methane is also
present. Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600 nm, in
the red and infrared portion of the spectrum.

Saturn

  <!-- Overview Content Start -->

Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar
System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about
nine and a half times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average
density of Earth.

Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn -->

  <!-- Overview Content End -->

  <!-- Internal Structure Content Start -->

Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass
is not in the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid
when the density is above 0.01 g/cm3, which is reached at a radius
containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass.

Source : Wikipedia <!-- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn#Internal_structure -->

  <!-- Internal Structure Content End -->

  <!-- Surface Geology Content Start -->

The outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25%
helium by volume. The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring
system, which is composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount
of rocky debris and dust.
